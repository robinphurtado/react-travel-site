# Travel Advisor App

This App displays an interactive map with nearby Restaurants, Hotels, and Attractions based on the user's location or a searched location.

This project is adapted from the [Build and Deploy a Google Maps Travel Application](https://youtu.be/UKdQjQX1Pko?si=9h9I4Qb4xc7_NG5X) tutorial by **JavaScript Mastery**.

It is my first full React site incorporating an interactive map and accessing the user's location. 
This app incorporates the google-map-react API for the map  and material UI for visual elements.
